Title: Building a Community of Practice
slug: community
---

In this post we set out the steps we have taken to build the NHS Python community into a community of practice, and highlight the opportunities we created for new members to get involved with the running of the community.

## What is a community of practice?

Communities of practice have been set up to bring together teams across government who share common job roles, responsibilities or remits, but otherwise are working in departmental/organisational silos. Their aims are to foster communication, interaction, and provide opportunities to share knowledge, ideas and experience.

Both the Central Digital and Data Office and the Government Digital Service in the Cabinet Office have developed resources over the years to help new communities of practice get started.

## The NHS Python Community for Healthcare

Our community was set up to champion the use of python programming and open-source code in the NHS and healthcare sector. Python is an open source, state of the art programming language, used by analysts, developers, data scientists, and data engineers. Python's widespread adoption is, in part, due to its accessible 'human readable' syntax, making it relatively easy to pick up and learn. In fact, Python is already used extensively throughout the NHS and healthcare community.

### NHS Python Community Board

The NHS Python Community Board exists to oversee the operations and activities of the NHS Python Community project. The Board will be responsible for promoting these principles and aims:

The NHS.pycom board meetings will meet monthly. It will govern, and provide a check and challenge function on project teams and will act as the parent group to any future sub-committees and technical advisory groups that form.

Board members are appointed for a 1 year term. Before the next financial year, the Board will vote on a fair procedure that will elect the next term's board members.

In accordance with communities' commitment to the principle of openness and transparency, the board summary notes will be published online, available here: <https://github.com/nhs-pycom/nhs.pycom/tree/main/board_notes>

## Executive Team

We expanded the NHS Python community team with new roles to create an executive group that can take forward the work building a community of practice. These are volunteer roles (as are all roles in the community) but require an appropriate level of time commitment: i.e., approximately 2 hours per week.

We were particularly looking for early-carers / apprentices / trainees who want to get involved. In this case, enthusiasm is more important than experience.
