Whilst sneezing and coughing on a relatively cool evening, I decided to explore seasonal allergic rhinitis (hayfever) prescribing data. The far off aim is to build a model using pollen count data and the prescribing data. In this ongoing process, I have faced multiple challenges.

In the first posts of a two-part series, I describe the methods used to exctract data from the CKAN API using `requests` and `pandas`

In the second posts of this two-part series, I aim to increase time efficiency of my data exctact, to explore the data, and to connect to a remote server in preparation for computationally expensive tasks.
